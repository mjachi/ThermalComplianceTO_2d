Like the finite element method itself, Topology Optimization found its first motivations in mechanical engineering;
for this reason, the classic problem is to construct a stiff structure in the design domain that minimizes the
\textit{compliance} (or, strain energy) under the given boundary conditions.

In the ideal, we would be able to
