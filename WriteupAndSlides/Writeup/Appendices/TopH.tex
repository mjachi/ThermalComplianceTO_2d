See \autoref{lst:toph} for the implementation; here, we will work through the details to the code. \texttt{toph.jl}
is a direct translation
into Julia of the \texttt{toph} listing from the appendices in \cite{bendsoe_sigmund_topopt}. Due to Julia's
design and syntax, the codes end up being quite similar, though the Julia version may be more
familiar to a generally experienced programmer.

The problem is to minimize the thermal compliance in the unit square as was done in \autoref{sec:thermal_compliance_classic_unit_square}.
